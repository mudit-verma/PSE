# Pleasantly Simple Experience v0.1

As the name suggests, I want you to have a pleasantly simple experience while using this font.\n
However, I don't think the font is quite there yet. Hence, 'v0.1'.\n
\n
I used InkScape to make the glyphs. I then imported the glyphs(.svg) into Font Forge to assemble the font for export.\n
GPOS tables are a gift!

## Next Release Goals
 - Add support for glyphs such as '/' and ';'
 - Further adjust kerning
 - Adjust default font size to match 12pt Times New Roman size
 - Validate font(partially at the very least)

## Validation Checklist
 - Integral Coordinates
 - Add extrema points
 - Fix overlap
