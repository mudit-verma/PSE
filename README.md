# *Pleasantly Simple Experience v0.1*

*As the name suggests, I want you to have a pleasantly simple experience while using this font.*

*However, I don't think the font is quite there yet. Hence, 'v0.1'.*

*I used InkScape to make the glyphs. I then imported the glyphs(.svg) into Font Forge to assemble the font for export.
GPOS tables are a gift!*

*You just simply need to download the .otf file and double click it.*
*That will prompt you to install the font on your computer. Once that's done, the font is at your disposal, ready for use!*
*Note that you'll need to bump up the size of the font to a high number (50-75) to get something readable. I do need to adjust scaling on the font.*

## Current Release Notes
 - Version 0.1.1
 - Released 5th October, 2024
 - *I replaced the orginal release file because errors popped up with filling strokes.*


## Next Release Goals
 - Add glyphs such as '/' and ';'
 - Further adjust kerning
 - Adjust default font size to match 12pt Times New Roman size
 - Validate font(partially at the very least)

## Validation Checklist
 - Adjust Non-Integral Coordinates to Integral Coordinates
 - Add Extrema Points
 - Remove Overlap
